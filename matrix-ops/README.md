# NumC

This project incorporates dynamic memory allocation, Python operator overloading, and speed up of matrix operations via both Intel AVX intrinsics and OpenMP directives.

Takeaways:
  - <b>The most interesting part to me about this project was that it involved getting accustomed to working with an API. While a bit complicated to navigate at first, I found that working with the C-Python interface was a good lesson in how the strengths of different programming languages can be combined to create one cohesive program that benefits from those strengths. The numc module I wrote in C worked exactly as expected in the Python interpreter, throwing the appropriate error messages when necessary. I found it pretty surprising how the API seamlessly overrides the default methods associated with certain operators with the methods I wrote in C.  </b>
  - <b>Another conclusion I derived from working on this project was that arriving at a solution to a particular problem does not mean that you reached the most efficient one. This was very apparent when I modified my implementation for the pow_matrix method. After changing my approach to matrix exponentiation via repeated squaring, my solution automatically became 180 times faster without needing to change my naive implementation for matrix multiplication. In addition to that, working with Intel AVX intrinsics was a nice lesson in the power of parallelism. In some cases, applying these to an algorithm is a fairly straightforward process. For example, in the case of the add_matrix and abs_matrix methods. In other cases like the mul_matrix method, where the algorithm is more complicated, incorporating intrinsics was definitely a tougher than expected. In fact, the hardest part of this project was figuring out how to optimize mul_matrix using these intrinsics. It took me quite a while to figure out when and where it would be best to load input matrix values into vectors for optimization operations. However, getting through all that trouble resulted in significant speedups for both pow_matrix and mul_matrix (413x for pow, 31x for mul). </b>
